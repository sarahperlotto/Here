Here is a location-based Android application for event discover and messaging. Please see the encolsed SRS for full implementation details. Please expect to make individualized alterations to this code to run it on your machine (i.e. API keys, potential server integration). 

Here was created as a group project for graduate school. I participated in a team of five other students, and the enclosed code represents the product we suvmitted for grading. My contributions are focused in the Event and EventCollection classes and UIs, including Google Maps API integration, Interests, Date and Time, and more.
